This is a basic banking system as a part of task at The Sparks Foundation. In this project I have created a basic banking system and hosted it with the help of xampp server. The flow should be like: Homepage-> view all customers-> Select and view one customer-> Transfer money-> Select customer to transfer to-> View all customers. There is no login page or user creation required. Firstly, I have created my customers table with 13 entries each containing details like name, email-id, phone number, account balance and address using SQL database.From my home page I can browse to customers page which shows us the list of customer details and here for each customer we can either view their details or transfer money to other customer. We can transfer money easily to a selected cutomer also keeping in mind that we cannot transfer more money that is in sender's account. After successfull completion of transcation, we will receive a message saying transaction is successful. Later we can also view the transactions we did earlier in table form by clicking on See all transactions. We can also see the changes in the account balance from view or customer page. We can also navigate to home page whenever it is required.
